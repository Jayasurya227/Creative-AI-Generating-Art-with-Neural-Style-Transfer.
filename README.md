# Creative AI: Generating Art with Neural Style Transfer ðŸŽ¨

This project explores the fascinating intersection of art and AI by implementing Neural Style Transfer. It uses a pre-trained deep learning model from TensorFlow Hub to combine the content of one image (e.g., a photo) with the artistic style of another image (e.g., a painting).

This notebook demonstrates how to load pre-trained models, preprocess images for style transfer, apply the style transfer algorithm, and visualize the creative results.

**Model:** Arbitrary Image Stylization model from TensorFlow Hub (`magenta/arbitrary-image-stylization-v1-256`)
**Input:** A content image and a style image.
**Focus:** Demonstrating Neural Style Transfer, using pre-trained models from TensorFlow Hub, image loading and preprocessing, model inference for image generation, and result visualization.

## Key Techniques & Concepts Demonstrated

Based on the implementation within the notebook (`Creative_AI_Generating_Art_with_Neural_Style_Transfer (1).ipynb`), the following key concepts and techniques are applied:

* **Neural Style Transfer:** An optimization technique used to take two imagesâ€”a content image and a style reference imageâ€”and blend them so the output image retains the core content of the content image but adopts the artistic style (texture, color palette, brush strokes) of the style image.
* **Pre-trained Models (TensorFlow Hub):** Leveraging a sophisticated, pre-trained arbitrary image stylization model available directly from TensorFlow Hub, eliminating the need for extensive model training.
* **TensorFlow Hub:** Using TF Hub (`hub.load`) as a repository to easily load and utilize pre-trained machine learning models.
* **Image Loading & Preprocessing:**
    * Using `matplotlib.pyplot` and `PIL` to load images.
    * Defining a function (`load_img`) to read images, convert them to `float32` tensors, scale pixel values to [0, 1], and add a batch dimension.
* **Model Inference:** Running the loaded style transfer model by providing the preprocessed content and style images as input. The model outputs the stylized image tensor.
* **Image Post-processing:** Converting the output tensor back into a displayable image format (e.g., NumPy array with `uint8` pixel values).
* **Visualization:** Using Matplotlib to display the original content image, the style image, and the final generated stylized image side-by-side for comparison.

## Analysis Workflow

The notebook follows a straightforward process for applying Neural Style Transfer:

1.  **Setup & Dependencies:** Importing necessary libraries (TensorFlow, TensorFlow Hub, NumPy, Matplotlib, PIL).
2.  **Load Pre-trained Model:** Loading the `magenta/arbitrary-image-stylization-v1-256` model from TensorFlow Hub.
3.  **Define Image Loading Function:** Creating the `load_img` function to handle image loading and preprocessing (scaling, adding batch dimension).
4.  **Load Content & Style Images:** Specifying file paths for the content image (e.g., `content.jpg`) and style image (e.g., `style.jpg`) and loading them using the defined function.
5.  **Apply Style Transfer:** Passing the preprocessed content and style image tensors to the loaded TensorFlow Hub model.
6.  **Retrieve & Post-process Output:** Getting the stylized image tensor from the model's output and converting it back to a standard image format (NumPy `uint8` array).
7.  **Visualize Results:** Displaying the content image, style image, and the generated stylized image using Matplotlib.

## Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **TensorFlow:** Core deep learning framework.
* **TensorFlow Hub (`tensorflow_hub`):** For loading the pre-trained style transfer model.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations and tensor/array manipulation.
* **Matplotlib:** For image loading and visualization.
* **Pillow (`PIL`):** For image file handling.
* **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab:** For the interactive development environment.

## Prerequisites

* **Content Image:** An image file to provide the content (e.g., `content.jpg`).
* **Style Image:** An image file to provide the artistic style (e.g., `style.jpg`).

*(Ensure these image files are present in the working directory or update the file paths in the notebook accordingly.)*

## How to Run the Project

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Jayasurya227/Creative-AI-Generating-Art-with-Neural-Style-Transfer.git](https://github.com/Jayasurya227/Creative-AI-Generating-Art-with-Neural-Style-Transfer.git)
    cd Creative-AI-Generating-Art-with-Neural-Style-Transfer
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    (It is recommended to use a virtual environment)
    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow tensorflow_hub numpy matplotlib Pillow jupyter
    ```
3.  **Prepare Images:** Place your desired `content.jpg` and `style.jpg` (or other named images, updating the notebook paths if necessary) in the repository directory.
4.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook "Creative_AI_Generating_Art_with_Neural_Style_Transfer (1).ipynb"
    ```
5.  **Run Cells:** Execute the cells sequentially. The TensorFlow Hub model will be downloaded automatically the first time it's loaded. The final cell will display the content, style, and generated stylized images.
